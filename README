This plugin allows Rails to look in a app/views/default if it cannot find your view file.

To use this plugin:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include BoochTek::Rails::DefaultViews
  end

OR

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    default_views
  end

You can find this plugin at http://github.com/boochtek/rails-default_views/.
