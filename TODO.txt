TODO
====
Refactor and clean up the code.
Use FALLBACK_VIEW_DIR constant, instead of hard-coding app/views/default/.
Allow the caller to specify a fallback directory.
Should we automatically inject the functionality into ActionController::Base, without explicitly including it?
    Probably, since why else would we install the plugin?
Support Rails 3.0, in addition to Rails 2.3.
    NOTE: Yehuda Katz suggests overriding _determine_template to provide the fallback, per http://yehudakatz.com/2009/07/19/rails-3-the-great-decoupling/.
Write a full test suite.
Does it make sense to make this a gem?
